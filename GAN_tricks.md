### My Experience
1. Do not use instance norm or layer norm in (at least first layer) D for image
    - layer norm cause contrast problem
    - instance norm cause color and contrast problem

### Tricks
1. Use leaky relu in down-sampling and relu in up-sampling

1. Use L1 distance instead of L2 in image reconstruction since L2 often leads blurriness

1. Network architectures
    -

1. Optimizing just for similarity in a high-level feature space typically leads to high-frequency artifacts. This is because for each natural image there are many non-natural images mapped to the same feature vector.

### Enhancement
1. TV loss for smoothness

### Traps

#### Coding Traps
1. To keep an eye on your image range [-1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0] or [0, 255]

#### Technique Traps
1. WGAN-GP
    - the normalization in discriminator shouldn't be batch normalization
